# CS201-FinalProject
# Inventory Management System

An Inventory Management System developed as a project for our final period.

## Features

- **User Management**: Add, update, and remove users.
- **Product Management**: Add, update, and remove products from the inventory.
- **Order Management**: Create, manage, and track customer orders.
- **PDF Invoice Generation**: Automatically generate PDF invoices for each order.
- **Database Integration**: Uses MySQL for storing and managing user, product, and order data.

  ## Side Notes:
- **Should first create inventory database in Command Line Client.
- **Change the Connection line from ConnectionProvider to fit own MySQL
- **Should run the Commented Statements from tables one by one. (aka st.executeUpdate)
